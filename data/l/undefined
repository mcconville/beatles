What Goes On

Right now, right now, right now
Please welcome... Ejaaaaac

[Verse 1]
How you doin? Nice to meet the beat
Had to run the track I got Nikes on my feet
No Mac Miller, my rap iller
I'm most dope and I smoke that killer
Pack it in the bowl or roll it in the blunt
Pepe le Pew, I'm smokin' on skunk
Pretty little flower got the power like Hulk
I'm a teen but I'm pro though, go for the dunk
Lame ones layup, need to get laid off
I'mma beat em like police or the Heat in the playoffs
Put your hood on, for Trayvon
I'm spittin' fire and I flow like napalm
Just gettin' hotter I ensure it, State Farm
Bring more fire than a turret, just stay calm
If you sleep, wake up, it's my dream
Like Simba one day I'll be king
I can't sing, but Hakuna Matata
Got brain get brain, medulla oblongata
The man with a plan, I am Obama
Can't do it without my fans, Katana
Tight(tied) like shoe strings, kick it like Liu Kang
Found me like Osama and I blew up Hussein
So propane, so profane
Headed straight for the top so Rogaine
You need to find your Nirvana, no Cobain
You Batman, but I'm so Bane
Beat you purple til you plummet no Soul Plane
I'm white and spit crack, I'm cocaine
I'm dope mane, with no vein
Fresh like the prince with no fame, but oh wait...
I will admit it, the attention got me itchin' for more
Riches and with this sentence I make sense(cents), but I'm piss po'
Ever since I got witnessed I'm relentless on gettin' gold
To glisten, glow, and gloat for listeners is my goal

[Hook]
I ain't worried bout nothin, nope
I ain't worried, I ain't worried
I ain't worried bout nothin, uh uh
I ain't worried bout nothin, nope
I ain't worried bout nothin, uh uh
I ain't worried, I ain't worried
No I ain't worried bout nothin

Ejac
I ain't done, I ain't done
Let it ride

[Verse 2]
I ain't worried bout nothin
Dig it like shovels or just shove it
Closest to sick you could get is robitussin
Just save your words, put your tongue on a budget
Cause, I ain't worried bout nothin
Even at the edge of a cliff, no bluffin'
Bitch if you said I'm a dick go suck it
Volunteer givin' head, no Pat Summit
I'm at the peak you weak in the stomach
Haters that speak, better shut it for I fuck it
Made it to the net, you can call me Sam Pucket
Plan to hang around, Tim Duncan slam dunkin
Ugh, had to kick the do down, cause I'm profound
And I'm pro now, I'mma go round
Raidin' like Raiden and reppin' my hometown
Got Florida on my hat, no Kung Lao
I'm stunned how, is Zimmerman innocent
When he reminisces all his gun sounds
Well, what goes 'round comes 'round
Rest in peace to Trayvon, I'm done now


Think For Yourself

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Think for yourself and you'll find out
That a lot of those so-called authorities are bullshit
Yeah, ay, Jerm, Jerm
Yeah, ahhh! Ahhh!

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Ah, I'm the muh'fuckin' greatest, y'all don't know that yet
I don't need your money, you can hold that check
At the crib in some Polo sweats
I don't need a ho, that's what the hoes don't get, whoa (Woo)
I'm on my worst behavior (Woo)
Bad side piece with the pertinent flavor (Woo)
Muh'fuckers never loved us
Comin' for your money, muh'fucker don't trust us (Nah)
Uh, you ain't shit
Bought a brand new crib, yeah, I move that brick (Okay)
I don't want nothin' with your doo-doo clique (Okay)
Treat her like a dog how I do that bitch, uh
Done doin' promo (Promo)
And it's still motherfuckin' Most Dope (Most Dope)
Made a couple million off a brand
Muh'fucker, we ain't even got a logo, uh
Bitch, you better have my money (Must be feelin' myself)
I don't see anybody but me (Plan on killin' myself)
Keepin' shit too real (Keepin' shit too real)
See a muh'fucker like me gettin' money (How does it feel?)
Already been but I'm back for more
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Insomniac, I don't know what I got a mattress for
Don't sleep!

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
(Look bitch, don’t try and speak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
(Bitch I don't speak French, look bitch, don't try and speak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac (Oh, hello Q)
Yeah, yeah, said, said

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I'm a maniac, crazy, act insane
Think I might need a cage in fact
Chain reactions happen when I make a pact
A psycho, God made me that
'Cause I fade to black, I gets down like a plane attack
You muh'fuckers just made me laugh
Ha ha, God damnit, this ain’t a drill, do not panic
Let me see how loud you scream (Argh!)
I'm off the map, muh'fuckas start lookin'
But they're never gonna see where I be
She only speak French
Said "Bitch look, don't try and speak around me"
And I don't sleep at all
If you on that bullshit, I ain't gonna be involved
Shit, shit, shit
I could make a million puttin' my lyrics on a tee (Whoa)
Fearless, Jet Li, fourth quarter, Gretzky
Take your bitch, Joe Pesci, don't test me
Don't flex if you ain't got shit on me
And, you ain't got shit on me, come get it
(Come get it, come, come get it, come, come)
Jar full of fresh white snow, bag full of unleaded
I don't get enough credit (Get enough credit, whoa)
Don't sleep!

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
M-M-M-M-M-M
They done fucked up, huh?
The biggest bezzle, huh?
The don, Ricky Farrakhan, huh?
M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
My weed burnin', my chain glitter
He's self made, Mac Miller my real nigga
Fuck who don't like it, bitch, come see me
Fuck who don't like it, hitta, hitta, hitta
G-G-G-Gettin' money so complicated, I'm the shit, I'm constipated
Yo baby mama, straight G, let me use the crib to mail all the weed
California, Atlanta, white girl in a black Phantom
My top down, mid-December, ride with a big black fat nigga
Krispy Kreme then it's chicken wings, introduce, different things
Jet skis and the best weed, think it's fake? Bitch, test me
I'm jet-lagged, don't need a stylist, pants sag, Jimmy Fallon
Blowin' green in the green room, Def Jam like, "Boss really wildin'"
Yeah, they hate but won't box a nigga
Bought the estate from a boxer nigga
Paranoid, I'm walkin' round
I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga (Huh)
My chopper, nigga (Huh)
Hahahahaha! I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Said I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
(Look bitch, don’t try and speak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
(Bitch I don't speak French, look bitch, don't try and speak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac
I'm an insomniac, a muh'fuckin' insomniac

If I Needed Someone

[Intro]
Hey yeah, hey yeah

[Chorus]
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me
Yeah, I'm just givin' you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be, yeah
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only

[Verse 1]
Well, hello, good evenin'
I'm with you long as I'm breathin'
For every season, my girl, she keep on keepin' me decent
I'm workin', not takin' weekends
I barely got time for sleepin'
Searchin' for meanin', fiendin' for freakiness
How it's bein', shit
I been the coldest, since winter solstice, mmm
I had a soul, I know that shit is frozen, mmm
Out of control, I am a livin' moment, mmm
I got that dopamine, know if you want it, yeah
Feel like I'm runnin' out of time, a couple days behind
This shit that's runnin' through my mind
There ain't no way I'm fine
And maybe I'm just wastin' time
Sick of playin' games, get out my gymnasium
I am a collector, of money and pressure
There's nobody better, out of my skull, I'm Hannibal Lecter
Yes sir, killin' all the noise
You know how it go; first you build it, then destroy

[Chorus]
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me (I can be my own me, own me)
Yeah, I'm just givin' you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only (Only)
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need (Got what you need)
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be, yeah (That's how it be)
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Okay, scatter brain, scatter brain
On my own island, I'm a castaway, who rackin' up these accolades?
You already know, so I don't have to say
I'm comin' up with words just like a motherfuckin' Scrabble game
Don't put out my wildfire (Wild), wildfire (Wild)
Take me up a mile higher, a mile higher (Mile)
Talkin' shit, we outside, we outside
I'm makin' motherfuckin' classics in my downtime (Yeah)
I'm a giant, how the fuck you talkin' down to me?
This that shit that make a hater raise up out they seat
And I can't see you from my balcony
I'm in the clouds and you lookin' like the ground to me
Yeah, told 'em already, I tell 'em again
I'ma keep killin', I'm livin' until I'm a hundred and ten (Woo)
Yeah, invincible, this shit is never gon' end
So tell a friend to tell a friend
Who tell a friend, who tell a friend

[Chorus]
Well, I just need a little space, I can be my own me (I can be my own me, own me)
Yeah, I'm just givin' you a taste
It's some one and only, this that one and only (Only) (Woo)
Yeah, I got what you need, what you need, what you need (Got what you need)
Shit, you know how it be, how it be, how it be, yeah (That's how it be)
All I ever needed was some one and only, this that one and only

Drive My Car

[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I can't keep on
Losin' you over complications
Gone too soon, wait!
We was just hangin'
I can't seem to hold onto
Dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losin' you
I can't keep on losin' you

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Anderson .Paak]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
How many mistakes do it take 'til you leave
And I'm left with my hand on my face, all red
In the face, lookin' at you like "wait!"
I know I ain't a saint, if it ain't too late, well...
(I can't keep on losin' you) Don't run away so fast
Know my heart like gold, but it break like glass
Know my shit get old and I act so young
Baby, you so cold, never have no sun
You don't wanna grow up, yeah, that shit no fun
So when I get home, I'ma give you some
Make you feel like (Woo) when I hit that drum
Yeah, the dick ain't free, I don't give no fucks
Yeah, it's complicated, got you frustrated
Get home late and you don't trust me, baby
Way too drunk, you don't know what I'm sayin'
You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy
Complicated, got you frustrated
Every single night I keep you waitin'
You say you don't care, that's what you sayin'?
We both know that's some bullshit
Okay, we be fightin', we be reunitin'
Kiss me, touch me, tease me, me excited
God, the devil, who is who?
Tryna get through to you because...

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I can't keep on
Losin' you over complications
Gone too soon, wait!
We was just hangin'
I can't seem to hold onto
Dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losin' you

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Well
You can't go away, girl, I'ma need you
Play your games like they my ticket to an Ivy League school
Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude
I just eat pussy, other people need food (Hahaha)
Only got a little time and I ain't tryna spend it
Arguin' about who ain't givin' who attention
Startin' up the engine, need to reboot
I just eat pussy, other people need food
And I use every bone in my body
Keep on holdin' on to your trust
I know you don't want nuttin' to do with me
But just one more time, let's make love
One more time, it ain't much, fuck 'em all, let's be us
Summer's soft sweetness
Call late drunk, you hang up
What a mess I made us, sense, I make none
It's complicated, keepin' me up late
Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain
If it's love, then why the fuck it come with pain?
I just think that's some bullshit
Okay, it seem invitin', trust me, she's a titan
This week she like him, next week they fightin'
Need protection, all your dresses bulletproof
You're safe with me, girl

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak &  Mac Miller]
I can't keep on losin' you
Where the hell you goin'?
Where you takin' this trip to? Wait!
Don't move, don't stay, too
I can't keep on losin' you
Where the hell you goin'?
Wait!
Where the hell you goin'?

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I can't keep on
Losin' you over complications
Gone too soon, wait!
We was just hangin'
I can't seem to hold onto
Dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losin' you

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you

Nowhere Man

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Bob's dementia
Chapter one
Now here lies a great man, a man of the people
A man of the people, people (Yeah, oh)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, here he comes, it's the highly unprofessional
Hyper sexual, intellectual
Fried my brain, now I've become a vegetable
Travel with a gang of weird lookin' extraterrestrials (Mi-mi-mi-mi)
They left me on their ship and made their bitches call me "General"
The dick quake could make a bitch shake like she got Parkinson's
You out there politickin', I'm studyin' Darwinism (God)
I keep some bars and hit 'em like a hard collision (Bang)
Don't fuck around it's murder in this art exhibit
And I got the whole game on paralyzed 'cause my volume on amplified
It's slow as a biracial bitch that's waitin' on her hair to dry (I don't wanna go yet)
Are you prepared to die? Burnin' this Ameri-fry
Where people that protect you are the ones that have you terrified
I only act this way 'cause my soul so broken
I'm the illest that you know, you a low dose Motrin
Laryngitis, hepatitis, the AIDS virus
I guess that's what you get from bein' 'round a bunch of rat vaginas
And you (And you), you pussy I wouldn't fuck with, a drunk dick
The day I came back from being hostage to the Russian mob
Missin' a finger and see my brother shot (Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
I'm comin' for your neck, so hide your head inside your mother's box (Motherfucker)
It still ain't cliche to say, "Fuck the cops" (No)
Let's try it ("Fuck the cops")
'Cause I just smoked a bunch of rocks and walked around in just my socks
And made myself a birthday cake with caramel and butterscotch

[Bridge: Mac Miller, Hodgy & Mac Miller & Hodgy]
Tasty, tasty, that shit is tasty
This shit is tasty
Nigga, smoke

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
We servin' faster than the Chinese
This life carries a price cheaper than clown feet
Like prostitutes with hoops and combined weaves
Who hates herself inside
So she sellin' her punani by umami (ooh mind me?)
It's like my soul's inside the bowl
I hold it close, 'cause I don't know when it's my time to go
I'm blindin' fold, I hear my son laughing and time is froze
And he knows it, lookin' at me like "That's my pops," and I'm his goal, nigga
Motherfucker, I hit pockets, pickpockets
I'll beat you for your keys, bubblegum, and your bitch wallet
To his product, I'm a prodigy of a dead nigga
No name droppin', scribin' when nobody was dead meat when they came flockin'
Brain doctorin', where I left my hard dates
Small shakes and small dates, the ones I only call late in parlay
You know what the dark say, grab a bitch by the paw, ayy
Her name's Autumn, she happens to be fallin' on the wrong day

[Outro: Mac Miller, Hodgy & Mac Miller & Hodgy]
Nigga, tasty (Tasty), tasty
Tasty, that shit is tasty
That shit is tasty
Tasty, tasty, tasty, tasty

In My Life

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
They told me, "Don't make a promise you can't keep
All the drugs in your system, you can't sleep
How many times you had to buy a Plan B
For a girl you never bring back home to meet your family?"
Man, man, I swear it's what I dream about
Ever since my mom told me that she need me out
Always smoking weed, 'causing trouble, never clean the house
But I paid her back for everything; I guess we even now
Nothing better than some head after a long day
That's the only thing that ever keep mine on straight
And she asked me, "Why the long face?"
How I spent 350 dollars on this entrée?
I drown my sorrow in that bottle
Today is full of regret, find forever in tomorrow
Man up, what's the problem?
Everything is Jazz and I'm Stockton (Haha)

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Yeah
I know it seem a little bit strange
Sometimes, yeah, yeah
Everybody live a little, everybody die
Yeah, yeah
But that's life
Whatchu gonna do?
That's life
Baby, I would spend it all witchu

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, and I'm headed to the
Other side, where the grass is always greener
And your bitch is down to ride, but that ass is always meaner
See, my cash got deeper and my morals disappeared
Never thought I'd be a asshole, this my last show
Can I please get a standing ovation?
A hunnid naked bitches in my dressing room waiting
We lost a lot of blood for this fucked up nation
But me, I'm getting high, making love in that spaceship
So what are the basics? Tell me your problems
You losin' your job or, even worse, you don't got one
So hard to stay sober when you feeling fucked over so much
Always coming up short, you like the roach of a blunt, yeah
And I could never sleep at night
Fuck paying bills, I need a brand new lease on life
Why does doing wrong always feel so right?
Well, I guess, fuck it, that's life

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Yeah
I know it seem a little bit strange
Sometimes, yeah, yeah
Everybody live a little, everybody die
Yeah, yeah
But that's life
Whatchu gonna do?
That's life
Baby, I would spend it all witchu

[Bridge: Sia]
Now, I wish I could take all your pain
But when the toxin is fame
The drugs, they don't fill the hole, no
Connections the game
Wish you'd picked up the phone
Knew that I'd be your home, knew that you weren't alone
Knew that you weren't alone, knew that you weren't alone

[Outro: Sia]
I saw you act a little bit strange sometimes
You'd say:
"Yeah, everybody lives and everybody dies
One day"
Well, that's right
Whatchu gonna do?
But I wish
You could have spent it on the truth


Wait

Man I'm back to the future
I've travelled in the past, and I'm back with a rap cure
It's not so bad, just a little jet laggued
The 90's were the best but our times surely ain't wack
I got stacks of beats, I'm rich
Sharing with the poors, I should do politics
I'll fight Biff Tannen like he is Donald Trump
I'm moving like Bernie, to the rythm of the drums
And what about Nikes? I see no self laces
The future ain't complete, like Ni Ni Nikes

But at least the kid got his 3d touch
Wait! Do Mac Miller got an Iphone to go with his kush?
I don't know but with the last one I'm flying high
No need no hoverboard when I'm getting high
Watching Back To The Future, but they got no plants
I guess the movie's not the vision of a pothead
I got a cloudy vision of what's next
Must be the smoke, or that my head's a mess
Anyway, Marty said I'll kill it
So I'm back to the future to prove you that I won't miss it
Yeah Marty said I'll kill it
So I'm back to the future to prove you that I won't miss it
