Tomorrow Never Knows

[Verse 1]
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

[Verse 2]
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

[Verse 3]
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 4]
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

[Verse 5]
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

[Verse 6]
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living

[Outro]
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning


And Your Bird Can Sing

[Verse 1]
You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me

[Verse 2]
You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me

[Bridge 1]
When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

[Instrumental]

[Bridge 2]
When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

[Verse 3]
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me


She Said She Said

[Verse 1]
She said, "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad"
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

[Verse 2]
I said, "who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Bridge]
She said, "you don't understand what I've said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

[Verse 3]
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Bridge]
She said, "you don't understand what I said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

[Verse 4]
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Outro]
She said, "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
I know what it's like to be dead"


Doctor Robert

[Verse 1]
Ring, my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
Day or night he'll be there any time at all
Doctor Robert

[Chorus 1]
Doctor Robert
You're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can
Doctor Robert

[Verse 2]
If you're down he'll pick you up
Doctor Robert
Take a drink from his special cup
Doctor Robert

[Chorus 2]
Doctor Robert
He's a man you must believe
Helping anyone in need
No one can succeed like
Doctor Robert

[Bridge]
Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you
Doctor Robert

[Verse 3]
My friend works for the National Health
Doctor Robert
You'll pay money just to see yourself
With Doctor Robert

[Chorus 1]
Doctor Robert
You're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can
Doctor Robert

[Bridge]
Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you
Doctor Robert

[Outro]
Ring, my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
Ring, my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert


Elanor Rigby

[Intro]
Beatles forever

[Verse 1]
There's something about a Beatles song, that lives forevermore
The beauty of the harmonies, the sound of the Fab Four
All their music will live on and on (John 'n' Paul, George and Ringo)
They really taught the world to sing (She came in through the bathroom window)

[Chorus]
Beatles forever, "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"
Beatles forever, "All You Need Is Love", yeah yeah yeah
Beatles forever, "I Wanna Hold Your Hand," wooh
Beatles forever, "Hey Jude" and "Revolution" (number nine)

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause when you feel the beat, you've gotta move your feet
You get the rhythm and blues, and a pretty tune
Rock and roll eternity, that started out as Merseybeat

[Verse 2]
I try to write a good song, a song with feel and care
I think it's quite a good song, 'til I hear one of theirs
Makes you wonder how they did it (John 'n' Paul, George and Ringo)
I wish I knew the secret, yeah yeah yeah (She came in through the bathroom window)

[Chorus]
Beatles forever, "Strawberry Fields Forever" and ever
Beatles forever, "Nowhere Man" and "Penny Lane", yeah yeah yeah
Beatles forever, "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"
Beatles forever, "Get Back" and "Yesterday"

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause when you feel the beat, you've gotta move your feet
You get the rhythm and blues, and a pretty tune
Rock and roll eternity, that started out as Merseybeat
All the children sing

[Chorus]
Beatles forever, "Please Please Me", "Eleanor Rigby"
Beatles forever, "I Am The Walrus" (yeah yeah yeah) goo-goo g'joob
Beatles forever, "She Loves You", ooh, "Day Tripper"
Beatles forever, "Eight Days A Week", "Magical Mystery Tour"

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause when you feel the beat, you've gotta move your feet
You get the rhythm and blues, and a pretty tune
Rock and roll eternity, that started out as Merseybeat

[Outro]
Ah ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah ah-ah, ah-ah-all-ah
Ah, feel the beat, ah-ah-ah-ah, gotta move your feet ah-ah ah-ah
Rhythm and blues, ah-ah-ah-ah, pretty tune
Ah, rock and roll, ah-ah-ah-ah, eternity, ah-ah ah-ah
Started out, ah-ah ah-ah, as Merseybeat

Beatles forever
Beatles forever, yeah yeah yeah
Beatles forever


I Want To Tell You

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away

[Verse 2]
When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

[Bridge 1]
But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things

[Verse 3]
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

[Bridge 2]
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand

[Verse 3]
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

[Outro]
I've got time
I've got time


I'm Only Sleeping

[Verse 1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

[Verse 2]
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping

[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

[Verse 3]
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping

[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

[Verse 1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream

[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping


Here, There and Everywhere

To lead a better life
I need my love to be here
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her
Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her
Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there
I will be there, and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere


Love You To

[Verse 1]
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me

[Refrain 1]
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man

[Verse 2]
A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me

[Refrain 2]
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

[Interlude]

[Refrain 2]
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

[Verse 3]
There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins you'll see

[Refrain 3]
I'll make love to you
If you want me to
