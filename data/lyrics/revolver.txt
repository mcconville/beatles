She Said She Said

[Verse 1]
She said, "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad"
And she's making me feel like I've never been born

[Verse 2]
I said, "who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Bridge]
She said, "you don't understand what I've said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

[Verse 3]
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Bridge]
She said, "you don't understand what I said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

[Verse 4]
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"

[Outro]
She said, "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
I know what it's like to be dead"


Taxman

[Intro]
One, two, three, four
One, two...  (One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Verse 2]
Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Bridge]
If you drive a car, car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold, cold, I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, walk, I'll tax your feet
Taxman

[Guitar Solo: Paul McCartney]

[Refrain]
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Verse 3]
Don't ask me what I want it for
(Haha, Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more
(Haha, Mr. Heath)
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Verse 4]
Now my advice for those who die
(Taxman!)
Declare the pennies on your eyes
(Taxman!)
Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Outro]
And you're working for no one but me (Taxman!)


And Your Bird Can Sing

[Verse 1]
You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me

[Verse 2]
You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me

[Bridge 1]
When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

[Instrumental]

[Bridge 2]
When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round

[Verse 3]
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me


I'm Only Sleeping

[Verse 1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)

[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

[Verse 2]
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)

[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping

[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

[Verse 3]
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping

[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

[Verse 1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream

[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping


Good Day Sunshine

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 1]
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good, in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 2]
We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 3]
And then we lie, beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine


Tomorrow Never Knows

[Verse 1]
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

[Verse 2]
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

[Verse 3]
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 4]
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

[Verse 5]
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

[Verse 6]
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living

[Outro]
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning

Got To Get You Into My Life

[Verse 1]
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

[Verse 2]
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

[Refrain]
Got to get you into my life

[Verse 3]
What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

[Refrain]
Got to get you into my life

[Short interlude]

[Chorus]
Got to get you into my life

[Outro]
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?


For No One

[Verse 1]
Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

[Verse 2]
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

[Bridge]
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 3]
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

[French Horn Solo]

[Bridge]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 4]
You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him

[Verse 5]
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

[Bridge]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

He does everything he can
Doctor Robert

[Verse 2]
If you're down he'll pick you up

Take a drink from his special cup
Doctor Robert

[Chorus 2]
Doctor Robert
He's a man you must believe
Helping anyone in need
No one can succeed like
Doctor Robert

[Bridge]
Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you
Doctor Robert

[Verse 3]
My friend works for the National Health
Doctor Robert
You'll pay money just to see yourself
With Doctor Robert

He helps you to understand
He does everything he can

Ring, my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
