Norwegian Wood

I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?


What Goes On

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

[Verse 1]
The other day I saw you as I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you, I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

[Verse 2]
I met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning, I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
I used to think of no one else but you were just the same
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?


Nowhere Man

[Verse 1: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison]
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

[Verse 2: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison]
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command

[Verse 3: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison]
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man can you see me at all?

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Nowhere man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand

[Verse 4: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison]
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command

[Verse 1: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison]
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody


You Won't See Me

[Verse 1]
When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have heard enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I get turned away

[Chorus]
And you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Bridge]
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

[Verse 3]
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Bridge]
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

[Verse 3]
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Outro]
Ooooh oh la la-la
Ooooh oh la la-la


I'm Looking Through You

[Verse 1]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Verse 2]
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Bridge]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 3]
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

[Bridge]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 4]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Outro]
Yeah, oh, baby, you've changed
Ah, I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you
You changed, you changed, you changed, you changed


In My Life

[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

[Bridge 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

[Bridge 2: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

[Outro: John Lennon]
In my life, I love you more


The Word

[Verse 1]
I never felt better (I never felt better)
I never felt better than the rain in the summer when the suspense the ? on a needle like a record ? the vinyl
I never felt better, than sunny weather penetrating a storm cloud
Seems to swallow me drawn out of obscurity
? and snoopy you looking at me
One of me
Feeding it, going out into the sunshine (..shit)
I disappear when I appear
No one really notice me unless I'm sayin' some dumb shit
I'm always saying dumb shit, oh shit
Here come Lucy with the damn football again (Ha!) (I won this time)
Days don't go nowhere...(echo)
Days don't go nowhere...(echo)
My days don't go nowhere..nowhere..

[Verse 2]
Let me get the ball
Swear I can kick it
Set it down proper so I get a good look at it
Look like it's gonna be a goal
So here I go, or do I know that it's... What I got to lose?
I'm running towards you full sprint, bout to be a cool kid
Instead of what they see me as a foolish cat who's hopeless
Wasn't dope, since he took second at the spelling bee
Cuz he couldn't spell the word beagle (beagle)
Little do they know that I am flyer than an eagle
Caryin' a navy seal but kicked that bitch Lucille in the face
So call me a disgrace
Whenever she around she gotta look at this taste
And she just, swallowed a tube of Colgate toothpaste
You win some, you lose weight, she got a two-face personality
She always mad at me, but now I'm 'bout to show her
I'm about to blow her mind after I kick this football over the skyline
And yo! It's my time to shine in these kicks yo
Oh it's my time to shine in these kicks yo
Yeah!

Days don't go nowhere...(echo)
Days don't go nowhere...(echo)
My days don't go nowhere..days don't go no, where..
Oopsie, daisy, never go again, never go again, never go again
Oopsie, daisy, never go again, never go again, never go again
Can I kick it? (No you can't)
Can I kick it? (No you can't)
Can I kick it? (No you can't)
Can I kick it? (No you can't)
Oopsie, daisy, never go again, never go again, never go again
Oopsie, daisy..days don't go nowhere, days don't go nowhere
Oopsie, daisy, never go again, never go again, never go again (days don't go nowhere, days don't go nowhere)
Oopsie, daisy, never go again, never go again, never go again (days don't go nowhere, days don't go nowhere)
Oopsie, daisy, never go again, never go again, never go again (days don't go nowhere, days don't go nowhere)
Oops..


Drive My Car

[Verse 1]
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

[Verse 2]
I told that girl that my prospects were good
And she said baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

Beep beep'm beep beep yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

[Verse 3]
I told that girl I can start right away
When she said listen, babe, I got something to say
I got no car and it's breakin' my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

[Outro]
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!


If I Needed Someone

[Verse 1]
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

[Verse 2]
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

[Bridge]
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

[Verse 3]
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 4]
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone

[Bridge]
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

[Verse 3]
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah
