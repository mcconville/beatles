In My Life

[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

[Bridge 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

[Bridge 2: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

[Outro: John Lennon]
In my life, I love you more


Wait

What was meant to be
What once mattered I
Got it shattered I
Waited p
Atiently
For a reason so
I could stay another day

One single day
Day
Day
That day
That day
Do you waste another (day)
Do you lose another (day)
Day
And wait

What I tried to flee
Got it on my back
And it scares me I guess
All the "could have beens"
Would not just be dreams
So I need another day

One single day
Day
Day
That day
That day
Do you waste another (day)
Do you lose another (day)
Day
And wait

Do you lose another
Do you waste another day

One single day
Day
Day
That day
That day
Do you waste another (day)
Do you lose another (day)
Day
And wait
Do you lose another day


Michelle

[Verse]
Affirmative action is for white women
I thought you knew this by now, but it seems you wasn't listening
A lot of feminists be acting like they down with it
But when it comes down to it, trust me they ain't down with it
Piggybacking off our struggles, who you fooling?
They be talking down on black women and y'all wanna recruit 'em
Nah, I never had jungle fever, y'all don't please me
I just bust a nut in you ducks because you easy
I never vibe with feminists
'Cause every time we move the needle
Y'all go Michelle Beadle and play that victim shit
White hoes like Mega Man, blast you 'til you drop
Take all of your powers and keep gunning for the top
Where were y'all feminists when Emmett Till got killed
And George Stinney Jr. was murdered
Making picket signs?
I'm spitting facts, unbiased
How can you trust a group whose only goal is to be white men's sidekick
And you age like leather bags, you zombies
Binders full of women but my name ain't Romney
With those lips and those hips, you ain't down mommy
Stop fronting, acting black is your damn hobby
Don't trust 'em, just fuck 'em, don't love 'em
They are not your friends, they are cacs stop frontin'
Fuck they race, fuck they creeds, fuck they world
It'd be a cold day in hell before I'm down with a swirl (nigga)


What Goes On

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

[Verse 1]
The other day I saw you as I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you, I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

[Verse 2]
I met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning, I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
I used to think of no one else but you were just the same
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?


You Won't See Me

[Verse 1]
When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have heard enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I get turned away

[Chorus]
And you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Bridge]
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

[Verse 3]
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Bridge]
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

[Verse 3]
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)

[Outro]
Ooooh oh la la-la
Ooooh oh la la-la


Think For Yourself

[Verse 1]
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

[Verse 2]
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

[Verse 3]
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

[Outro]
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you


Nowhere Man

[Verse 1: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison]
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

[Verse 2: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison]
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command

[Verse 3: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison]
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man can you see me at all?

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Nowhere man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand

[Verse 4: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison]
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command

[Verse 1: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison]
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody


I'm Looking Through You

[Verse 1]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Verse 2]
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Bridge]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 3]
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

[Bridge]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 4]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Outro]
Yeah, oh, baby, you've changed
Ah, I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you
You changed, you changed, you changed, you changed


Norwegian Wood

I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?


Girl

Baby grind on me, relax your mind take your time on me
Let me deeper shawty, ride on me
Now come and sex me 'til your body gets weak
We slow grinding baby

[VERSE 1]
When I hit 'em I make 'em say (Oh)
Sex be my day (JOB)
I hit 'em in the back of my (CAR)
Make 'em ride like a see (SAW)
I make 'em laugh and giggle
Cuddle a little
Suck on the nipple
Lick the whip cream from the middle
Girlfriend I never go (RAW)
I rip off panties and I pop off (BRAS)
B.L.U.E.S.T.A. (R)
Ask around the block how freaky we (ARE)
I drink Red Bull so I keep stamina
Rubbing your belly
Busting your brains
Whats my name (whats my name)
Pretty Rickie, Pretty Boy
Doing pretty good thangs
Making pretty good change
Yeah pretty good breaks
From the pretty, pretty chicks
Yeah pretty damn rich
Pretty Rickie, Rickie Rickie
And the Mavericks

[Hook]

[VERSE 2]

Slow motion bout to put this thing on ya baby

[Hook]

[VERSE 3]
Slick got more game than a little bit
Baby girl 5' 5", brown eyes with them thick lips
Thick thighs with the slim hips
Sugar honey, ice tea
Baby girl is so sweet
And a bag of chips
I like to catch her when she coming home
Like side with a cherry thong
Eat her up like a sundae cone
But as of morning you got me open
Your tongue is stroking no joking
Coochie swollen, the bedroom smoking
GET SOME AIR UP IN THIS ROOM GIRL
(beathes heavily)
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
So I'mma take my time and do it right
Caz we got all night ..... caz we got all night, baby girl just

[Hook]
