Two Of Us

[Intro; John Lennon]
I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Outro]
We're going home
Better believe it
Goodbye


For You Blue

[Intro]
(Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members)

[Verse 1]
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do

[Verse 2]
I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment, girl, for you

(Bop, bop cat bop)

(Go, Johnny, go)

(Them ol' 12-bar blues)

(Elmore James got nothing on this, baby)

[Verse 3]
I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me and that's all you had to do
I feel it now I hope you feel it too

[Verse 1]
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I'm livin' the blues


Across The Universe

Paroles de la chanson Across The Universe :
Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world


Dig A Pony

[Verse 1]
I dig a pony
Well, you can celebrate anything you want
Yes, you can celebrate anything you want
Oh!
I do a road hog
Well, you can penetrate any place you go
Yes, you can penetrate any place you go
I told you so

[Chorus]
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

[Verse 2]
I pick a moon dog
Well, you can radiate everything you are
Yes, you can radiate everything you are
Oh, now
I roll a stoney
Well, you can imitate everyone you know
Yes, you can imitate everyone you know
I told you so

[Chorus]
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Ooh, now
I feel the wind blow
Well, you can indicate everything you see
Yes, you can indicate anything you see
Oh now
I load a lorry
Well, you can syndicate any boat you row
Yeah, you can syndicate any boat you row
I told you so

[Chorus]
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because


The Long And Winding Road

[Verse 1]
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

[Bridge]
Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried

[Verse 3]
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

[Orchestral Solo]

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting)
Lead me to your door

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


I Me Mine

[Verse 1]
All through the day
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
All through the night
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day
I me mine

[Chorus]
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine

[Verse 2]
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day
I me mine

[Chorus]
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine

[Verse 2]
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through your life
I me mine


One After 909

[Verse 1]
Once upon an era, rose petals graced
The path of Gods among the greats and crushed beneath my walking taste
Thorns pierced the soul but left the seven unscathed
Unabraised praise the fresh step the maker had made

Im built to be anything that I want
So I became haraam the baddest to fuck a mom
Praise god self affirmation is law
To the point that I see my moniker peppered in psalms

Step the beaten path of the one with 99 calls
Ar-Rahman, Al-Aziz, Al-Malik, As-Salam
Word is bonded in my mental my temple is a mosque
A barrage of sacred salahs from a carbon dated Quran

Head in uncharted summits bars harder to stomach
I travel a different gullet I come from a different cuspate
Transmit to mother ships transcend on some other shit
Drop knowledge and vomit, cuss and spit for the fuck of it

I am the sultans gold the sheik on a higher throne
A dome parted between but linked like a herringbone
Stink of a fresher tone ring a bell in a soul
Graphite could scar a foe I etch in a better stone

Diamond aesthetics my platinum shine in ya retinas


Let It Be

Chillin i’m smoking this herb
Away from the syrup
Cause that shit real serious
They thicker than syrup
Back home in the burbs
Temp below seven
That pussy like heaven
All over my tongue
Tell ‘em it’s yum
Beat up the pussy
Ba da bum bum
I’m dripping like leatherby’s
Temp above seventy
Quick to just let it be
Beatle philosophy

South side on the mic
H-TOWN ’til I D-I
E’s used to keep the O’s high
But I cleaned the money
Now my pockets tired
South side on the mic
H-TOWN ’til I D-I
E’s used to keep the O’s high
But I cleaned the money
Now my pockets pockets

I think the atmosphere changed
12:23 when I laid
I got that message that you up there chillin cooling with saints

See I’m on cloud nine when I hit the j
Go ahead throw dirty on my name
Still light to find in the shade
No way
Gotta up the chase
Before the window fade
Gimme lemons please for my lemonade
How I’m begging pleading to Orion’s rays
Pinky ring need a heavy thang
The only thing to change is everything
Look [redacted]
Not to gloat
I got lil baby touching tippy toes
Riding with my woes
Fuck your gender quo
Just natural
You don’t get it tho
Lil nigga
Six figure not something
Ima need some more scrilla
Need the bag to clear up
Cause my old shawty got a new whip and new nigga
No not bitter
Never sit up
With her picture
Of us kissing
Reminiscing
How we touching fucking in the kitchen
Call you lil baby, you shout papi princeton

CD skippin’. Fuck

I’m on DND
I smoke 28.4 a week
I need to catch some snores, I think
The mink’s just too blingy
For me
Wanna write his history
That ain’t a stutter
Signed the lease
I blink and she unzip the jeans
Set the beat, so denim clean
Wink and pink get owerflowing
Save her as Atlantic Ocean
Keep a Trojan rubber on me
I’m at badlands, chicas lonely
Don’t you see this water on me
Blew the doja on the roady
All these lights they scatter. only
Thing i see the matter is the homies
Ride

Niggas want the quick fade
Me I want a temp fade
See lil shawty
Got the kind of body
Make a young nigga get her bills paid
Flip a quarter if I got to
More than one stream of revenue
Couple ways I could get to you
Stimulating your mental
Candles on
Blonded playing on YouTube
On the color tube
In the livingroom
Babygirl can I ask you
Little shawty can I ask you
Did your last nigga get this attitude?
Feel like you in a bad mood
So sorry that I’m

Not feeling you
The way that you was feeling me
Before we had this interlude
Now it seem like me and you
Don’t equal two

It’s just one plus one and that seem like a bad move

RIDE

RIDE


Dig It

[Verse]
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like the FBI
And the CIA
And the BBC
B.B. King
And Doris Day
Matt Busby, dig it, dig it
Dig it, dig it, dig it

[Spoken]
That was "Can You Dig It" by Georgie Wood
And now we'd like to do "Hark the Angels Come"


Maggie Mae

Oh, dirty Maggie Mae, they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street anymore
Oh, the judge he guilty found her for robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbing Maggie Mae
This is a part of Liverpool, they returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay


Get Back

But she was a frying pan
Sweet Rosetta Martin... Rosetta
The picker, the picker, picture the fingers burning

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last

For some California grass

Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo

But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Oh, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta
