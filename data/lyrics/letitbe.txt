The Long And Winding Road

[Verse 1]
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

[Bridge]
Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried

[Verse 3]
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

[Orchestral Solo]

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting)
Lead me to your door

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


I Me Mine

[Verse 1]
All through the day
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
All through the night
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day
I me mine

[Chorus]
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine

[Verse 2]
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day
I me mine

[Chorus]
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine

[Verse 2]
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through your life
I me mine


Dig It

[Verse]
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like the FBI
And the CIA
And the BBC
B.B. King
And Doris Day
Matt Busby, dig it, dig it
Dig it, dig it, dig it

[Spoken]
That was "Can You Dig It" by Georgie Wood
And now we'd like to do "Hark the Angels Come"


Across The Universe

Paroles de la chanson Across The Universe :
Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world


Dig A Pony

[Verse 1]
I dig a pony
Well, you can celebrate anything you want
Yes, you can celebrate anything you want
Oh!
I do a road hog
Well, you can penetrate any place you go
Yes, you can penetrate any place you go
I told you so

[Chorus]
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

[Verse 2]
I pick a moon dog
Well, you can radiate everything you are
Yes, you can radiate everything you are
Oh, now
I roll a stoney
Well, you can imitate everyone you know
Yes, you can imitate everyone you know
I told you so

[Chorus]
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Ooh, now
I feel the wind blow
Well, you can indicate everything you see
Yes, you can indicate anything you see
Oh now
I load a lorry
Well, you can syndicate any boat you row
Yeah, you can syndicate any boat you row
I told you so

[Chorus]
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because
