Paroles de la chanson With A Little Help From My Friends :
With A Little Help From My Friends

What would you think if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Ummm I get high with a little help from my friends
Ummm Going to try with a little help from my friends

What do I do when my love is away
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because you're on your own)
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Ummm I get high with a little help from my friends
Ummm Going to try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

Would you believe in a love at first sight
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Ummm I get high with a little help from my friends
Oh I'm Going to try with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Ummm Going to try with a little help from my friends
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends!


When I'm Sixty-Four

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge 1]
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

[Verse 2]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge 2]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

[Verse 3]
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Outro]
Whoo!


A Day in the Life

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

[Chorus: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
*Alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today—oh, boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

[Chorus: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on

[Instrumental Outro]


Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Speech]

[Ringo] I'm Ringo and I play the drums
[Paul] I'm Paul and I play the ehm bass [Chhhh]
[George] I'm George and I play a guitar [whistle]
[John] I'm John and I too play guitar, sometimes I play the fool


Within You Without You

[Verse 1]
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away

[Verse 2]
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

[Chorus 1]
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

[Chorus 2]
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

[Sounds of Laughter]


Getting Better

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]​
It feels bad for me to feel this good
They told me that i'd grow up so good
But my momma was an addict
Poppa was an addict
I been working at it
I feel I should
And if you need me to be less of this oh so bitterness
I dunno what to tell u
We all get to gone when it's on
We all play the pawn to get along
And I been getting armed for the bombs
Falling down on me now
Find another round find another vein
Put me in the ground or the sky's the same
Either way i'm down to live out in the rain
Just Get me my fix and I won't complain

[Hook: Wrekonize]
If you're wondering how i been
You know me
I say i'mma quit then I OD
If you're wondering how i been
You know me
You see I say i'mma quit then I OD

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]​
It's no good for me to feel this bad
Whiplash from the withdrawals I've had
But see I been getting better bottles getting set up
Crack another stella I can't go back
And if you need me to be less of this oh so bitterness
I'm thinking we should part ways
We all play the fool it's never cool
How we been all aloof to ridicule
Acting sorta crude i never knew you'd come down on me now
Find another track find another pill
Find another glass make sure that it's filled
Time that I relapse relax and lemme chill
Just Get me my fix and i'll be still

[Hook: Wrekonize]
If you're wondering how i been
You know me
I say i'mma quit then I OD
If you're wondering how i been
You know me
You see I say i'mma quit then I OD


Fixing A Hole

[Verse 1]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 2]
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Bridge]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

[Verse 3]
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door

[Verse 4]
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah

[Outro]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go


She's Leaving Home

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes down the stairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (Bye-bye)
For so many years

[Outro]
She's leaving home (Bye-bye)
