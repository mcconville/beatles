Back in the U.S.S.R.

[Verse 1]
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way, the paper bag was on my knee

Yeah, back in the U.S.S.R


Revolution I

[Corey Gipson - Space]

[Verse 1]
Let's see it long it lasts
How wide his vision
How much depth he have?
Maybe the next up
Or maybe you'll just look at laugh
A contradiction studying crunching optimism
Optimus on flows my soul knows no opposition
Its all perspective ain't
So I'm a live chasing different planets climbing mountains
Painting pictures carving canyons
The lens is dirty
Gone clean the glass
Never read Koran but wash my feet and clean my ass
Common sense ain't that common in the common lands
But never viewed myself as a victim or a common man
A child, im learning here
Forget the path we're walking now we're only talking earnings here
We're burning here

[Chorus]
Space...
Can I live

[Verse 2]
Let's see how long it lasts
How wides his vision
What kinda depth he have
Maybe the next up or maybe you'll just look in laugh
Complicated overdosing on conversation
Trying to drop tapes tell the world cops the compilation
Working harder
Pushing farther
Trying to find my limits
Do it larger
That's word to my father
Here do it bigger
Gone picture me
Crystal clear, resolution clear
When I wrestle beats
Rest in peace
You gone need dimension trying measure me, Literally
Read lines see the signs
We only the what's physically
And paper it's paper thin

[Chorus x2]

Im chasing wormholes...


Mother Nature’s Son

[Verse 1]
Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long, I'm sitting singing songs for everyone

[Verse 2]
Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies

[Verse 3]
Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun

[Outro]
Mother Nature's son


 Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da

Glass Onion

[Verse 1]
I told you 'bout Strawberry Fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows

[Refrain]
Looking through the bent back tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion

[Verse 2]
I told you 'bout the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well, here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul

[Refrain]
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion

[Verse 3]
I told you 'bout the fool on the hill
I tell you, man, he living there still
Well, here's another place you can be
Listen to me

[Refrain]
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion


Happiness is a Warm Gun

[Verse 1: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
(...down)
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

[Verse 3: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun

[Chorus]
Happiness is a warm gun (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, momma (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)

When I hold you in my arms (ooh, oh, yeah)
And I feel my finger on your trigger (ooh, oh, yeah)
I know nobody can do me no harm (ooh, oh, yeah)
Because

(Happiness) is a warm gun momma (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Well, don't you know that happiness is a warm gun momma?
(Is a warm gun, yeah)

While My Guitar Gently Weeps

[Verse 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Bridge 1]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 2]
I look at the world, and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge 2]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 3]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
(I look) Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh

Yer Blues

[Intro]
Two, three...

[Verse 1]
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 2]
In the morning
Want to die
In the evening
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 3]
My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 4]
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bones
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 5]
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll
Want to die
Yeah, want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why


Good Night

[Verse 1]
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

[Bridge]
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight

Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

[Instrumental bridge]
Mmm

[Verse 2]

Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

[Outro]
Good night
Good night, everybody
Everybody, everywhere

Piggies

[Verse 1]
Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies, life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

[Verse 2]
Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

[Bridge]
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their life, there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking!

[Verse 3]
Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

[Outro]
One more time


Revolution 9

[Spoken Intro: Alistair Taylor & George Martin]
...bottle of claret for you if I'd realised. I'd forgotten all about it George, I'm sorry
Well do next time
Will you forgive me?
Mmmyes
Cheeky bitch

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number

[Verse 1]
Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen time your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9

Who's to know?
Who was to know?

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

[Verse 2]
I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

[Bridge]
Right! Right!
Right, right, right, right!
Right!
Right!

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

[Verse 3]
I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rogue doctors have brought this specimen

I have nobody's short-cuts, aha

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

With the situation

They are standing still

Upon the telegram

Ooh ooh

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

Ooh

[Verse 4]
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low

[Pre-Chorus]
Alright!

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

[Verse 5]
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So instead I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea

Block that kick, block that kick!

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Um da
Aaah

[Verse 6]
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The Twist

El Dorado

Take this brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh

[Verse 7]
Maybe even then
Exposure could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked
If you become naked

[Outro]
Hold that line, hold that line!
Block that kick, block that kick!
