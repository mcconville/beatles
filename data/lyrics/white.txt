[Verse 1]
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

[Bridge]
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight

[Bridge]
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

[Instrumental bridge]
Mmm

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight

Good night, sleep tight

[Bridge]
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

[Outro]
Good night
Good night, everybody
Everybody, everywhere
Good night

Rocky Raccoon

[Verse 1]
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

[Hook]
And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"

[Hook]
And now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

[Outro]
C'mon, Rocky boy
C'mon, Rocky boy


Blackbird

[Verse 1]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

[Verse 2]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

[Chorus]
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

[Verse 1]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

[Outro]
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise


Yer Blues

[Intro]
Two, three...

[Verse 1]
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 2]
In the morning
Want to die
In the evening
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 3]
My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 4]
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bones
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 5]
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll
Want to die
Yeah, want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why


Don’t Pass Me By

[Verse 1]
I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it--does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Verse 2]
I hear the clock a'ticking on the mantel shelf
See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Chorus]
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's alright, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you

[Chorus]
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

[Chorus]
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry


While My Guitar Gently Weeps

[Verse 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Bridge 1]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 2]
I look at the world, and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge 2]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 3]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
(I look) Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh


Revolution 9

[Spoken Intro: Alistair Taylor & George Martin]
...bottle of claret for you if I'd realised. I'd forgotten all about it George, I'm sorry
Well do next time
Will you forgive me?
Mmmyes
Cheeky bitch

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number

[Verse 1]
Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen time your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9

Who's to know?
Who was to know?

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

[Verse 2]
I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

[Bridge]
Right! Right!
Right, right, right, right!
Right!
Right!

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

[Verse 3]
I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rogue doctors have brought this specimen

I have nobody's short-cuts, aha

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

With the situation

They are standing still

Upon the telegram

Ooh ooh

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

Ooh

[Verse 4]
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low

[Pre-Chorus]
Alright!

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

[Verse 5]
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So instead I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea

Block that kick, block that kick!

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Um da
Aaah

[Verse 6]
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

[Chorus]
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The Twist

El Dorado

Take this brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh

[Verse 7]
Maybe even then
Exposure could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked
If you become naked

[Outro]
Hold that line, hold that line!
Block that kick, block that kick!


Piggies

[Verse 1]
Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies, life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

[Verse 2]
Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

[Bridge]
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their life, there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking!

[Verse 3]
Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

[Outro]
One more time


Sexy Sadie

[Verse 1]
Sexy Sadie, what have you done?
You made a fool of everyone

Sexy Sadie, oh, what have you done?

Sexy Sadie, you broke the rules
You laid it down for all to see
You laid it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie, oh, you broke the rules

[Bridge 1]
One sunny day, the world was waiting for a lover (Sexy Sadie)
She came along to turn on everyone
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them all (Sexy Sadie, she's the greatest)

[Verse 3]
Sexy Sadie, how did you know?
The world was waiting just for you
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie, oh, how did you know?

[Verse 4]
Sexy Sadie, you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie, oh, you'll get yours yet

[Bridge 2]
We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
(Sexy Sadie)
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie, she's the latest and the greatest of them all

[Outro]
Ooh woo
She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie

However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie

She was a working girl North of England way
Now she's hit the big time in the U.S.A
And if she could only hear me, this is what I'd say

[Verse 1]

Kindly send her sailing back to me?

The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He's the all-American bullet-headed Saxon mother's son

All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes

All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce", his mommy butted in
"If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him"

All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill

Revolution I

[Corey Gipson - Space]

[Verse 1]
Let's see it long it lasts
How wide his vision
How much depth he have?
Maybe the next up
Or maybe you'll just look at laugh
A contradiction studying crunching optimism
Optimus on flows my soul knows no opposition
Its all perspective ain't
So I'm a live chasing different planets climbing mountains
Painting pictures carving canyons
The lens is dirty
Gone clean the glass
Never read Koran but wash my feet and clean my ass
Common sense ain't that common in the common lands
But never viewed myself as a victim or a common man
A child, im learning here
Forget the path we're walking now we're only talking earnings here
We're burning here

[Chorus]
Space...
Can I live

[Verse 2]
Let's see how long it lasts
How wides his vision
What kinda depth he have
Maybe the next up or maybe you'll just look in laugh
Complicated overdosing on conversation
Trying to drop tapes tell the world cops the compilation
Working harder
Pushing farther
Trying to find my limits
Do it larger
That's word to my father
Here do it bigger
Gone picture me
Crystal clear, resolution clear
When I wrestle beats
Rest in peace
You gone need dimension trying measure me, Literally
Read lines see the signs
We only the what's physically
And paper it's paper thin

[Chorus x2]

Im chasing wormholes...

Savoy Truffle

[Verse 1]
Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's Good News
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Verse 2]
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down the blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Bridge 1]
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You'll shout aloud

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Bridge 2]
You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Ob-La-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?

[Verse 1]
Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's Good News
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

[Outro]
Yes, you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

None of you man can't walk in my shoe
Better respect a real don when I come through
When I see you, what do I see?

Don't talk like that again, do you hear me?
More time German roll with a beanie

Big man ting, nah mate, not me
Me run from you? Nah, never that
I could never be shook, trust me
All you lot just better keep training
You better know which part you're aiming
I don't wanna hear no one complaining
When it gets dark and it don't stop raining

[Hook]
I ain't worried, mate, do I look worried, mate?
I'm happy to wake up and see another day
I'm not worried, cuz, do I look worried, cuz?
How the hell is that shit gonna worry us?
Scared? (Who, me?) Nah, I ain't shook (Who, me?)
Nah, I ain't shook (Who, me?) Nah, I ain't shook (Who, me?)
Me, scared? (Who, me?) Nah, I ain't shook (Who, me?)
Nah, I ain't shook, I don't wanna hear no chat, just trust me when I tell you that I ain't


Mother Nature’s Son

[Verse 1]
Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long, I'm sitting singing songs for everyone

[Verse 2]
Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies

[Verse 3]
Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun

[Outro]
Mother Nature's son


Back in the U.S.S.R.

[Verse 1]
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way, the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight

[Chorus]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S.S.R. (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Been away so long, I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey, disconnect the phone

[Chorus]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Bridge]
Well, the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
Oh, come on!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Bridge]
Well, the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind

[Verse 3]
Oh show me round your snow-peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm

[Chorus]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R. (hey)
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Outro]
Oh, let me tell you, honey
Hey, I'm back, I'm back in the U.S.S.R
Hey, it's so good to be home
Yeah, back in the U.S.S.R
