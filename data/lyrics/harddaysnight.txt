And I love her

I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her

She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her


Can't buy me love

you can't do that

[Verse 1]
I’ve got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I’m going to let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that

[Verse 2]
Well, it’s the second time I’ve caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it’s a sin
I think I'll let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that

[Bridge]
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

[Verse 3]
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!

[Guitar Solo]
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)

[Bridge]
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

[Verse 4]
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!


when I get home

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

[Verse 1]
Come on, on my way
'Cause I'm-a going to see my baby today
I've got a whole lot of things I've gotta say to her

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

[Verse 2]
Come on if you please
I've got no time for trivialities
I've got a girl who's waiting home for me tonight

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

[Bridge]
When I'm getting home tonight
I'm going to hold her tight
I'm going to love her till the cows come home
I bet I'll love her more
Till I walk out that door
Again

[Verse 3]
Come on, let me through
I've got so many things I've got to do
I've got no business being here with you
This way

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home, yeah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home


Things we said today

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinkin' of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

[Verse 2]
You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

[Bridge]
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

[Verse 3]
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

[Bridge]
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

[Verse 3]
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today


I should have known better

[Verse 1]
I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do

[Verse 2]
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

[Bridge]
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too

[Verse 3]
So I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

[Bridge]
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're going to say you love me too

[Outro]
You love me too, you love me too
You love me too


Any time at all

[Chorus]
Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there

[Verse 1]
If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
I'll be there to make you feel right

If you're feeling sorry and sad
I'd really sympathize
Don't you be sad, just call me tonight

[Chorus]
Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there

[Verse 2]
If the sun has faded away
I'll try to make it shine
There's nothing I won't do
When you need a shoulder to cry on
I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight, and I'll come to you

[Chorus]
Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there

Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there

Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there


if I fell

[Intro: John Lennon]
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

[Bridge]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If I fell in love with you

I'll Be Back

[Verse 1]
You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

[Bridge 1]
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

[Verse 2]
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time, I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

[Bridge 2]
I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I got a big surprise
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

[Verse 3]
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

[Bridge 1]
I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

[Outro]
You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again


I'll cry instead

[Verse 1]
I've got every reason on earth to be mad
Cause I've just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I'll cry instead

[Verse 2]
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I'll cry instead

[Bridge]
Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away-hey
But I'll come back again someday

[Verse 3]
And when I do you better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead

[Bridge]
Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away-hey
But I'll come back again someday

[Verse 3]
And when I do you better hide all the girls
'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead
