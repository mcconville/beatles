[Intro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer (writer, writer)

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney, McCartney & Lennon  & Harrison]
Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book?
It took me years to write, will you take a look?
It's based on a novel by a man named Lear
And I need a job, so I want to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer!

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney, McCartney & Lennon  & Harrison]
It's a dirty story of a dirty man
And his clinging wife doesn't understand
His son is working for the Daily Mail
It's a steady job, but he wants to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer!

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer (writer, writer)

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, (Lennon & Harrison), McCartney & Lennon  & Harrison]
It's a thousand pages, give or take a few (Frère)
I'll be writing more in a week or two (Jacques)
I could make it longer if you like the style (Frère)
I can change it 'round and I want to be a paperback writer (Jacques)
Paperback writer!

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney, (Lennon & Harrison), McCartney & Lennon  & Harrison]
If you really like it, you can have the rights (Frère)
It could make a million for you overnight (Jacques)
If you must return it, you can send it here (Frère)
But I need a break, and I want to be a paperback writer (Jacques)
Paperback writer!

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer (writer, writer)

[Outro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Paperback writer, paperback writer
Paperback writer, paperback writer
Paperback writer, paperback writer
Paperback writer, paperback writer


Lady Madonna

[Intro: Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

[Bridge 1: Paul McCartney]
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

[Bridge 2: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
[Tenor Saxophone Solo: Ronnie Scott]
See how they run

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

[Bridge 3: Paul McCartney]
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

[Outro: Instrumental]

Old Brown Shoe

[Verse 1]
I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long

[Chorus 1]
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you

[Verse 2]
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown

[Chorus 2]
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[Bridge]
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me, hey

[Instrumental Verse]

[Bridge]
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

[Verse 3]
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late, hey

[Chorus 3]
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

[Outro]
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You know who loves you
You know who loves you
You know who loves you
You know who loves you

You know who loves you
You know who loves you
You know who loves you
You know who loves you
You know who loves you
You know


Revolution

[Verse 1]
You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know you can count me out

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright, alright

[Verse 2]
You say you got a real solution
Well you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
We're doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright, alright

[Verse 3]
You say you'll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright, alright

[Outro]
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright


The Ballad Of John And Yoko

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
"You can make it O.K
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said, "Say what you doing in bed?"
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Bridge: John Lennon]
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
"Poor boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you
But your soul - think!"

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said, "She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag"

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Verse 5: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, "We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back"

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

[Outro]
