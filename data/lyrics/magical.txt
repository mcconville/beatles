The Fool On The Hill

[Verse 1]
Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Verse 2]
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

{Instrumental bridge}

[Verse 3]
And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Round and round and round and round and round

[Verse 4]
And he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

[Chorus]
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Outro]
Oh (Round and round and round)
Oh

Blue Jay Way

[Verse 1]
There's a fog upon L.A
And my friends have lost their way
"We'll be over soon", they said
Now they've lost themselves instead

[Chorus]
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
For I may be asleep

[Verse 2]
Well, it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet

[Chorus]
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
For I may be asleep

[Verse 3]
Now it's past my bed I know (Know)
And I'd really like to go (Go)
Soon will be the break of day (Day)
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way (Way)

[Chorus]
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
Or I may be asleep
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long
Please, don't be long
Please, don't you be very long
Please, don't be long

[Outro]
Don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long
Don't be long, don't be long


Strawberry Fields Forever

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 2]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 3]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think a "no", I mean, a "yes", but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

[Outro]
Cranberry sauce


I Am The Walrus

[Verse 1]
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying

[Verse 2]
Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

[Verse 3]
Mister City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying

[Verse 4]
Yellow-matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

[Bridge]
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

[Chorus]
I am the egg man (now good sir, what are you?)
They are the egg men (a poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)
I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob (good pity)
G'goo goo g'joob

[Verse 5]
Expert, textpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
(ho ho ho, hee hee hee, ha ha ha)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying

[Verse 6]
Semolina pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob, g'goo
Joob! Joob! Joob!

[Bridge]
Joob! Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob! Joob! Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob!

[Outro]
Umpa, umpa, stick it up your jumper
Everybody's got one, everybody's got one
“Villain, take my Purse. If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my Body
And give the Letters which thou findst about me
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester: seek him out upon the English Party. Oh, untimely death, death–”
“I know thee well, a serviceable Villain; as duteous to the Vices of thy Mistress as badness would desire.”
“What, is he dead?”
“Sit you down, Father; rest you.”


Penny Lane

[Verse 1: Mad Child]
White python, night-lights on
Mike Tyson, I'm white lighting
Complete freak on the beat by Viking
Black heat, enemies don't like 'em
Keep on fighting, keep reciting
Writing; he will defeat these titans
Speak like a king, live like a pirate
Move like a gypsy, cause small riots
Not tall giant, also flying
No joke no matter how broke I am
Don't go crying, won't start lying
City's a jungle, still I'm a lion
Feel good as I am without doing dope
Mad Child clean like mouth full of soap
No doubt not out with the bros
Just stay above water like house is a boat
Small blue pills thousands of those
Back that's a place that I'll never go
Difficult centrifugal force
Or the simplest flows like wind through the door

[Verse 2: Prevail]
You killed that shit man
Warriors for life dig up the swollen army
Shout to my young brother Trey Nice
I'm about to get him out of this high-tempo BPM shit
Rob the Viking live from the estuary. P1
S&M. What's up? Come on Rob, let's get 'em

Oil spill top kill fills at the mortuary
My life a wild life I'm live from the estuary
S.O. shell BPR VIP I kill like military
Spilling red liquid everywhere just like a bloody mary
Bloody like the movie Carrie, wise man mother Mary
Secret symbolism come across like the Maltese
Battle-axe warriors I'm tattooed like a Maori
Hear my war cry, I paralyze it so powerfully
And how can he do what I can't, rocking it like Element
Show me attitude and you'll get branded like a cattle ranch
Man you spitting garbage bitch, I'm like a Harvard graduate
Conception is immaculate, back from the dead like Lazarus
Novel is protagonist, * and vice and avarice
Dropping from my speech each and every letter of alphabet
Genetic spikes precisely accurate like laws of Calculus
Vocal like Ted Noble so fucking with me is hazardous
Ferris wheel, carousel, kerosene, everything
Burn down the carnival, very strange penny lane
Beatles Rolling Stones Pink Floyd
Black light acid trips sink into the void oh boy

[Mad Child]
I'm done, I'm tired of being a pawn on the chess board
War comes got straps and a vest for it
Fuck pills, fuck coke, fuck escorts
Fuck being a gangster and fuck being dead for it

[Prevail]
White gold crushed chrome powdered aluminum
Old school trains, hop the bottom, rustoleum
Yeah, my name's Prevail I'm on your trail like Ho Chi Minh
Dude I'm too crude highly flammable petroleum

It's the sound of the drum coming at you like a heart
Hit you in the face with the bass booming in the car
It's the sound of the drum, you can run but you won't get far

[Verse 3: Mad Child]
Creator of this abstract dark art poetic style
Mad Child saying that bull will be pathetic pal
Least I didn't forget it beast still deeply embedded
This MC from BC still deeply regretting now
I lost concentration and focus on what was important
Must have been the pills and all the coke I was snorting
Now I'm telling all my folks that I'm sober and it's over
But I know that if you put it to my nose I still could go for it
That's why I keep reminding myself and going over it
It's very dramatic to date a heroin addict
Had a bad relationship, good girl but wanted out like I was seeing ghosts
And hearing voices in a haunted house, I'm known for fucking up
And acting stupid and erratic
I get fully loaded like the bullets slipped into the clip
And clicked into the pistol grips of semi automatics
I was a terrible addict but the kids back at it

It's the sound of the drum coming at you like a heart
Hit you in the face with the bass booming in the car
It's the sound of the drum, you can run but you won't get far
(I wanna rock right now)

You say why and I say I don't know, oh no

[Chorus]

And I say go go go (Till it's time to go)
Oh, oh no

[Chorus]
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, oh, oh
Hello

[Outro]
Hela, heba helloa
Hela, heba helloa, cha cha cha
Hela, heba helloa, woo!
Hela, heba helloa, hela!
Hela, heba helloa, cha cha cha
Hela, heba helloa, woo-hoo!
Hela, heba helloa, cha cha cha
Hela, heba helloa, cha cha cha


Baby You're A Rich Man

[Verse 1]
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be?
And have you traveled very far?
Far as the eye can see

[Verse 2]
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too

[Verse 3]
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby, baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
Oh, baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, baby you're a rich man, too


Flying

All the souls in the nighttime
Fly around like mosquitoes
Wrapped in silk, with their white eyes
They will frighten the people

Flying beetles are buzzing
Falling down by the window
Acting crazy for nothing
In Antananarivo

Twins will bring you all misfortune
Mama leave them in the sun to die
And everybody knows the children burn likewise

So here in Antananarivo, we know
Every secret will remain
Yeah, here in Antananarivo, we know
No one leaves the town for good

Twins are hiding in coffins
Playing games in the houses
Children turning to orphans
While they're sorting the spices

They are smearing their bodies
With the blood of the dead ones
In every street you see the ghost of fate

So here in Antananarivo, we know
Every secret will remain
Yeah, here in Antananarivo, we know
No one leaves the town for good
In Antananarivo

So here in Antananarivo, we know
Every secret will remain
Yeah, here in Antananarivo, we know
No one leaves the town for good
In Antananarivo


All You Need Is Love

Paroles de la chanson All You Need Is Love :
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
There's nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you
In time - It's easy

All you need is love, all you need is love
All you need is love, love, love is all you need
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
All you need is love, all you need is love
All you need is love, love, love is all you need
There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy
All you need is love, all you need is love
All you need is love, love, love is all you need
All you need is love (all together now)
All you need is love (everybody)
All you need is love, love, love is all you need
