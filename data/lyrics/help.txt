It's Only Love

[Verse 1]
I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Verse 2]
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Outro]
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you


You've got to hide your love away

[Verse 1]
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

[Chorus]
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

[Verse 2]
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

[Chorus]
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

I've Just Seen A Face

[Verse 1]
I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm

[Verse 2]
Had it been another day I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
Di-di-di-di'n'di

[Chorus]
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Verse 3]
I have never known the like of this I've been alone
And I have missed things and kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this
Da-da-n'da-da'n'da

[Chorus]
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Verse 1]
I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-da-da-da

[Chorus]
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Outro]
Oh, fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again


Yesterday

Paroles de la chanson Yesterday :
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they’re here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly, I’m not half the man I used to be
There’s a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don’t know she woldn’t say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Mm mm mm mm mm


You Like Me Too Much

[Verse 1]
Though you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Verse 2]
You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Bridge]
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me

[Verse 3]
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Refrain]
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Bridge]
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me

[Verse 4]
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you


Yes

[COMPANY]
The engine roared, the motor hissed
And who could see how the road would twist?
In Sweeney’s ledger the entries matched:
A beadle arrived, and a beadle dispatched
To satisfy the hungry god of Sweeney Todd
The demon barber of Fleet...
Sweeney!
...Street
Sweeney!
Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney!
Sweeney! Sweeney!

Hunchbacks dancing!
Stirrings in the ground
And the whirring of giant wings!
Watch out!

Blotting out the moonlight
Thick black rain falling on the

Not while I’m around …

[TODD]

Where are you hiding?
Nothing’s gonna harm you, darling

[TODD]
Nothing to be afraid of, boy…

Demons are prowling everywhere
Nowadays

[BEGGAR WOMAN]
Beadle! Beadle!
No good hiding, I saw you!
Are you in there still
Beadle? Beadle?
Get her, but watch it!
She’s a wicked one, she’ll deceive you
With her fancy gowns
And her fancy airs
And her —
Mischief! Mischief!
Devil’s work!
Where are you, Beadle?

[ANTHONY]
Mr. Todd?

[JOHANNA]
No one here. Where is this Mr. Todd?

[ANTHONY]
No matter. He’ll be back in a moment, for I trust him as I trust my right arm. Wait for him here. I’ll return with the coach in less than half an hour

[JOHANNA]
But they are after us still. What if they trace us here? Oh, Anthony, please let me come with you

[ANTHONY]
No, my darling, there is no safety for you on the street

[JOHANNA]
But dressed in these sailor’s clothes, who’s to know it is I?

[ANTHONY]
No, the risk is too great
Ah, miss
Look at me, look at me, miss, oh
Look at me please, oh
Favor me, favor me with your glance
Ah, miss
Soon we’ll be, soon we’ll be gone
And sailing the seas
And happily, happily wed in france

[ANTHONY/JOHANNA]
And we’ll sail the world
And see its wonders
From the pearls of Spain
To the rubies of Tibet—


[ANTHONY]
And then come home to London
Some day.
[JOHANNA]
And then home
Some day.
[ANTHONY]
I’ll be back before those lips have time to lose that smile

[BEGGAR WOMAN]
Beadle!
Beadle! Where are you?
Beadle, dear!
Beadle!
Beadle deedle deedle deedle deedle dumpling
Beadle dumpling, be-deedle dumpling...

[TODD]
You! What are you doing here?

[BEGGAR WOMAN]
Ah, evil is here, sir. The stink of evil — from below — from her! Beadle dear, Beadle!

[TODD]
Out of here, woman

[BEGGAR WOMAN]
She’s the devil’s wife! Oh, beware her, sir. Beware of her. She with no pity in her heart

[TODD]
Out, I say!

[BEGGAR WOMAN]
Hey, don’t I know you, mister?

[TURPIN]
Mr. Todd, sir!

[TODD]
The judge. I have no time

[TURPIN]
Where is she? Where is the girl?

[TODD]
Below, your honor. With my neighbor, Mrs. Lovett. Thank heavens the sailor did not molest her. Thank heavens, too, she has seen the error of her ways

[TURPIN]
She has?

[TODD]
Oh yes, sir, your lesson was well learned. She speaks only of you, longing for forgiveness

[TURPIN]
And she shall have it. She’ll be here soon, you say?

[TODD]
I think I hear her now

[TURPIN]
Oh, excellent, my friend!

[TODD]
Is that her dainty footstep on the stair?

[TURPIN]
I hear nothing

[TODD]
Yes, isn’t that her shadow on the wall?

[TURPIN]
Where?

[TODD]
There! Primping
Making herself even prettier than usual

[TURPIN]
Even prettier …
If possible

[TURPIN]
Oh, pretty women!

[TODD]
Pretty women, yes …

[TURPIN]
Quickly, sir, a splash of bay rum!

[TODD]
Sit, sir, sit

[TURPIN]
Johanna, Johanna

[TODD]
Pretty women

[TURPIN]
Hurry, man!

[TODD]
Pretty women are a wonder

[TURPIN]
You’re in a merry mood again today, barber

[TODD]
Pretty women!

[TURPIN]
What we do for


[TODD]
Pretty women!
Blowing out
Their candles
Or combing out their hair
Even when they leave
They still
Are there
There... they’re there
[TURPIN]
Pretty women!
Blowing out
Their candles
Combing out their hair, then they leave
Even when they leave you
And vanish, they somehow
Can still remain
There with you, there
[TURPIN]
How seldom it is one meets a fellow spirit!

[TODD]
With fellow tastes—in women, at least

[TURPIN]
What? What’s that?

[TODD]
Oh, sire, the years no doubt have changed me. But then, perhaps, the face of a barber—the face of a prisoner in the dock—is not particularly memorable

[TURPIN]
Benjamin Barker!

[TODD]
Benjamin Barker!
Rest now, my friend
Rest now forever
Sleep now the untroubled
Sleep of the angels

[COMPANY]
Lift your razor high, Sweeney!
Hear it singing, “yes!”
Sink it in the rosy skin
Of righteousness!

[MRS. LOVETT]
Die! Die! God in heaven—die! You! Can it be? How all the demons in hell are sent to torment me!

[TODD]
Why did you scream? Does the judge live still?

[MRS. LOVETT]
He was clutching, holding on to my skirt, but now he’s finished

[TODD]
Leave them to me. Open the oven doors

[MRS. LOVETT]
No!

[TODD]
Open the doors!

[MRS. LOVETT]
No! Don’t go near her!

[TODD]
What is the matter with you, woman? It’s only some meddling old beggar– Oh no! Oh good god…”don’t I know you?” she said… you knew she lived. From the first moment that I came into your shop you knew my Lucy lived!

[MRS. LOVETT]
I was only thinking of you!

[TODD]
Lucy

[MRS. LOVETT]
Your Lucy! A crazy hag picking bones and rotten spuds out of alley ash-cans! Would you have wanted to know that she ended up like that?

[TODD]
You lied to me

[MRS. LOVETT]
No, no, not lied at all. No, I never lied

[TODD]
Lucy…

[MRS. LOVETT]
Said she took the poison—she did
Never said that she died—poor thing, she lived

[TODD]
I’ve come home again

[MRS. LOVETT]
But it left her weak in the head
All she did for months was just lie there in bed

[TODD]
Lucy

[MRS. LOVETT]
Should’ve been in hospital
Wound up in bedlam instead
Poor thing!

[TODD]
Oh, my god!

[MRS. LOVETT]
Better you should think she was dead
Yes, I lied ‘cause I love you!

[TODD]
Lucy…

[MRS. LOVETT]
I’d be twice the wife she was!
I love you!

[TODD]
What have I done?…

[MRS. LOVETT]
Could that thing have cared for you like me?

[TODD]
Mrs. Lovett
You’re a bloody wonder
Eminently practical and yet
Appropriate as always
As you’ve said repeatedly


There’s little point in dwelling on the past
No, come here, my love ..
Not a thing to fear
My love
What’s dead
Is dead.
[MRS. LOVETT]
Do you mean it?
Everything I did I swear
I thought was only for the best
Believe me!
Can we still be married?
[TODD]
The history of the world, my pet

[MRS. LOVETT]
Oh, Mr. Todd
Ooh, Mr. Todd
Leave it to me ..

[TODD]
Is learn forgiveness and try to forget

[MRS. LOVETT]
By the sea, Mr. Todd
We’ll be comfy-cozy
By the sea, Mr. Todd
Where there’s no one nosy …

[TODD]
And life is for the alive, my dear


So let’s keep living it!
Just keep living it
Really living it!
[MRS. LOVETT]
We'll keep living it!
Really living it!
[TODD]
There was a barber and his wife
And she was beautiful
A foolish barber and his wife
She was his reason and his life
And she was beautiful
And she was virtuous
And he was naive

[TOBY]
Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker man. Bake me a cake. No, no, bake me a pie to delight my eye, and I will sigh if the crust be high! Mr. Todd. Pat him and prick him and mark him with a "b", and put him in the oven for baby and me!

Another Girl

[Chorus]
For I have got another girl
Another girl

[Verse 1]
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

[Chorus]
For I have got another girl
Another girl

[Verse 2]
She's sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you, "This time you'd better stop"

[Chorus]
For I have got another girl
Another girl

[Bridge]
Who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend

Another girl

Help!

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help
Oh my God, I know
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help

[Post-Chorus]
Oh my God, I know
My God, I know
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Sick of getting played now
Sick of feeling strange now
If I could open up my arm instead of building up a wall I would truly be amazed now
But the gates get higher
More flames in the fire
Everyone around me got a chance, but baby, I'm just waiting on my turn
Thoughts weighing down too quick
Got flaws, under y'all make me drown when I think
It's a problem
Push away until they stop calling
The brawling, give 'em my strength and we'll stop and
Help

[Pre-Chorus]
Can anybody read the sign?
As I sleep, I can see you just to ease my mind
Feeling guilty if anyone ever see me cry
Yet all those people who I'm feeling for would walk on by

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help
Oh my God, I know
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help

Post-[Chorus]
Oh my God, I know
My God, I know
My God, I know
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Would you believe me if I said I'm alone?
Sitting and thinking while I kick it at home
Contemplating questions I'mma never really know
So to cope with it, down a couple drinks and get stoned
I'm a dreamer
A dreamer who don't do enough
Breaking heart, see what I can do to trust
Fall into the lust
Hesitate to open up
It's hard when my words start slurring when I sober up
Clock ticks, all I got is nonsense
Cuz the plot twists, caught me off guard, now I lost it
Ever since, I been tryna get it back
To concerned about opinions so I never check the facts

[Pre-Chorus]
Can anybody read the sign?
As I sleep, I can see you just to ease my mind
Feeling guilty if anyone ever see me cry
Yet all those people who I'm feeling for would walk on by

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help
Oh my God, I know
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help
Oh my God, I know

[Post-Chorus]
My God, I know
My God, I know
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help
Oh my God, I know
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help
Oh my God, I know

[Outro]
My God, I know
My God, I know
My God, I know
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Yeah yeah yeah


Tell Me What You See

[Verse 1]
If you let me take your heart I will prove to you
We will never be apart if I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me

[Verse 2]
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away
If you put your trust in me I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see
Don't you realise now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see

[Electric piano interlude]

[Verse 3]
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see

[Electric piano interlude]

[Verse 4]
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Hmm
