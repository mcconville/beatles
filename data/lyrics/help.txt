Help!

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help
Oh my God, I know
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help

[Post-Chorus]
Oh my God, I know
My God, I know
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Sick of getting played now
Sick of feeling strange now
If I could open up my arm instead of building up a wall I would truly be amazed now
But the gates get higher
More flames in the fire
Everyone around me got a chance, but baby, I'm just waiting on my turn
Thoughts weighing down too quick
Got flaws, under y'all make me drown when I think
It's a problem
Push away until they stop calling
The brawling, give 'em my strength and we'll stop and
Help

[Pre-Chorus]
Can anybody read the sign?
As I sleep, I can see you just to ease my mind
Feeling guilty if anyone ever see me cry
Yet all those people who I'm feeling for would walk on by

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help
Oh my God, I know
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help

Post-[Chorus]
Oh my God, I know
My God, I know
My God, I know
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Would you believe me if I said I'm alone?
Sitting and thinking while I kick it at home
Contemplating questions I'mma never really know
So to cope with it, down a couple drinks and get stoned
I'm a dreamer
A dreamer who don't do enough
Breaking heart, see what I can do to trust
Fall into the lust
Hesitate to open up
It's hard when my words start slurring when I sober up
Clock ticks, all I got is nonsense
Cuz the plot twists, caught me off guard, now I lost it
Ever since, I been tryna get it back
To concerned about opinions so I never check the facts

[Pre-Chorus]
Can anybody read the sign?
As I sleep, I can see you just to ease my mind
Feeling guilty if anyone ever see me cry
Yet all those people who I'm feeling for would walk on by

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help
Oh my God, I know
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help
Oh my God, I know

[Post-Chorus]
My God, I know
My God, I know
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help
Oh my God, I know
Everyday I'm in a battle with myself
As I fall down from my travels, I don't see nobody's help
Oh my God, I know

[Outro]
My God, I know
My God, I know
My God, I know
Oh-woah-oh-oh
Yeah yeah yeah


Ticket To Ride

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care
She said that living with me
Is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care
I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away, yeah, oh
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care
I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
She said that living with me
Was bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around, oh
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care


Act Naturally

[Verse 1]
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

[Bridge]
Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

[Verse 2]
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

[Verse 3]
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part and I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally

[Bridge]
Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

[Verse 4]
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally


I need you

[Verse 1]
You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you

[Verse 2]
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me

[Bridge]
Oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore

[Verse 3]
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you

[Bridge]
But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore

[Verse 3]
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you
I need you
I need you


The Night Before

Grow into a flower
Baby, used to see you shining
The sun is up
The night before
Bottles done
You’re calling me

You’re telling me what I should be
No, Baby you should see it
Ayy, Art like Mona Lisa

You’re all I ever needed and more
I miss your energy
I miss those memories
I need your touch on me
Your love on me
Your love on me

I’m doing shit they don’t like, yea
I got em’ feeing a vibe, yea
Doing the things that they say I can’t do because I’m taking hold of my life, yea
Patron in cup
I need it though
It gets me through when I am feeling low
Heavy emotions Im dealing with
Numb it all down so I can’t feel it anymore

Empty your thoughts when you’re next to me
If you wanna go, babe I’ll get the keys
We gotta make it through steadily
Tell me that I’m in your memory
All my emotions, they festering
When you’re away, need the rest of me
Something so good I just can’t believe that this kind of love ain’t a fantasy

Take it back girl
You know I be dying for you
Grow into a flower

Life’s a fantasy
Live it happily
For the life of me
Whats the point of it?
Life’s a fantasy (fantasy)
Live it happily (happily)
Just pinch me (just pinch me)
Whats the point of it?

Nothings working
I don’t see the purpose
Conversations with you turning worthless
Good times
Bad times
Sometimes we just burn it
Love and misfortune I just can’t discern it

Take it back girl
You know I be dying for you
Grow into a flower
Baby, used to see you shining
The sun is up
The night before
Bottles done
You’re calling me

You’re telling me what I should be
No, Baby you should see it
Ayy, Art like Mona Lisa

You’re all I ever needed and more

Tell Me What You See

[Verse 1]
If you let me take your heart I will prove to you
We will never be apart if I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me

[Verse 2]
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away
If you put your trust in me I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see
Don't you realise now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see

[Electric piano interlude]

[Verse 3]
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see

[Electric piano interlude]

[Verse 4]
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Hmm


It's Only Love

[Verse 1]
I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Verse 2]
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Outro]
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you


You Like Me Too Much

[Verse 1]
Though you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Verse 2]
You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Bridge]
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me

[Verse 3]
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Refrain]
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Bridge]
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me

[Verse 4]
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

You've got to hide your love away

[Verse 1]
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

[Chorus]
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

[Verse 2]
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

[Chorus]
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away


I've Just Seen A Face

[Verse 1]
I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm

[Verse 2]
Had it been another day I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
Di-di-di-di'n'di

[Chorus]
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Verse 3]
I have never known the like of this I've been alone
And I have missed things and kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this
Da-da-n'da-da'n'da

[Chorus]
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Verse 1]
I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-da-da-da

[Chorus]
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Outro]
Oh, fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again
