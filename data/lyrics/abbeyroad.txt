Golden Slumbers

[Verse 1]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Chorus]
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse 2]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry

[Outro]
And I will sing a lullaby


Octopus’s Garden

[Verse 1]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 2]
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe (Happy and they’re safe)
We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you

[Outro]
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you


Her Majesty

[Verse]
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah
Someday I'm going to make her mine


Maxwell’s Silver Hammer

[Verse 1]
Joan was quizzical;
Studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine 
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay
When the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be so, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
(Do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
(Do-do-do-do)

[Verse 3]
P. C. 31 said, "We caught a dirty one,"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, 
Screaming from the gallery, say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oa
(Do-do-do-do-do)
(Silver hammer man)


She Came In Through The Bathroom Window

[Intro]
Beatles forever

[Verse 1]
There's something about a Beatles song, that lives forevermore
The beauty of the harmonies, the sound of the Fab Four
All their music will live on and on (John 'n' Paul, George and Ringo)
They really taught the world to sing (She came in through the bathroom window)

Beatles forever, "I Wanna Hold Your Hand," wooh

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause when you feel the beat, you've gotta move your feet
You get the rhythm and blues, and a pretty tune
Rock and roll eternity, that started out as Merseybeat

[Verse 2]
I try to write a good song, a song with feel and care
I think it's quite a good song, 'til I hear one of theirs
Makes you wonder how they did it (John 'n' Paul, George and Ringo)
I wish I knew the secret, yeah yeah yeah (She came in through the bathroom window)

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause when you feel the beat, you've gotta move your feet
You get the rhythm and blues, and a pretty tune
Rock and roll eternity, that started out as Merseybeat

[Outro]
Ah ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah ah-ah, ah-ah-all-ah
Ah, feel the beat, ah-ah-ah-ah, gotta move your feet ah-ah ah-ah
Rhythm and blues, ah-ah-ah-ah, pretty tune

Started out, ah-ah ah-ah, as Merseybeat

Beatles forever
Beatles forever, yeah yeah yeah
Beatles forever


Because

Aaaah—Because the world is round it turns me oo-oon
Because the world is round

Aaaah—Because the wind is high it blows my mi-ii-nd
Because the wind is high

Aaaah—Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry-y
Because the sky is blue

Ah, ah, ah, ah


Sun King

[Chorus]
Aaah, here come the sun king
Here come the sun king

[Bridge]
Everybody's laughing
Everybody's happy

[Chorus]
Here come the sun king

[Outro]
Quando para mucho mi amore de felice corazón
Mundo paparazzi mi amore chicka ferdy parasol
Cuesto obrigado tanta mucho que canite carousel


Polythene Pam

[Verse 1]
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes "The News of the World"
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Hey!) Great!


I Want You (She’s So Heavy)

Started with a sharing of storeya
You're the courier I'm in new world like a foreigner
I should let the officer take me and get punished
Every rules I would break just to get a little close to you
Beatles playlist makes me say this, vibe that you bring
Got me grooving like it's 80's
We talked about the deepest, the midst and all the lamest
And that's the thing that keep you different from the other ladies
You know I hate to say this, but yun ang totoo
Napagawa mo sakin thing I never done before
Simple efforts that I did yeah you didn't ignore
Never thought that you would let me through sa iyong pinto
Ooppsss teka muna bakit tayo natatakot
Daan na yong napili sa malayo ba aabot
They say I don't have future men I don't believe in tarot
In case they cannot understand I mixed it with tagalog

Summer night summer summer night
It all started with just one summer night
Lets hope that all would be fine
Summer night, summer summer night
Lets hope that all would be fine

NBSB yan ang sabi kitang kita den sa labi
I just wanna make you happy, kailangan lang maghintay
For the right time para satin sounds like
You're tired while you're waiting on a lobby
Of a good hotel, I just want to tell you that I care
Even though I look so unprepared
Understatement kahit walang nag declare
Na to you I'm just a lighter acting like a chandelier eeyy
For that, rate me 5 star, hope you find what
You've been looking for like a man with fine stat
Guy with a fast car not with a bustard
Last time I checked I don't even own a bus card
Bagsak sa standard naka vanguard no direction magaling lang mag paandar, if the reason is the season well you got that wrong
All four sakin pwede ka sumandal

Summer night summer summer night
It all started with just one summer night
Lets hope that all would be fine
Summer night, summer summer night
Lets hope that all would be fine

Nobody's perfect that's what they said
For me the perfect thing is always what's inside your head
Everything you try to say should be a mofuckin thread
This dream is surreal it makes me wanna stay in bed
But I don't wanna beg, should I walk away instead
Tinamaan ng lintek doesn't mean that it is dead
We should know na dito sa mundo nothing is reserved
Kailangan ay malaman mo who do you deserve
Forcing things doesn't really take the pain away
You're undeniable like kobe made a fade away

I would love to stay each and every day
But it will happen if you really are for me
I would love to stay each and everyday
I would love to stay and never go away
I would love to stay each and every day
But it will happen if you really are for me
I would love to stay each and every day
I would love to stay like it's yesterday
I would love to stay each and every day
But don't know how to say and don't know how to say it
I would love to stay each and everyday
I would love to stay and never go away
I would love to stay each and every day
But it will happen if you really are for me


Mean Mr Mustard

[Verse 1]
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

[Verse 2]
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man


The End

You're feelin' lonely
You're feelin' cold
You're looking awful
You're lookin' old
Once you were handsome
Once you had friends
But this is over
This is the end
(Babababa) (4x)
I'm feelin' lonely too
I'm feelin' cold
I'm lookin' awful too
I'm lookin' old
Once I was handsome
Once I had friends
But this is over
This is the end
(Babababa) (4x)
(Instrumental)

Something

[Chorus]
A little bit of somethin', sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
A little bit of somethin', sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
You better hold on to what you got
Because what you think is nothin' to someone else may be a lot

[Verse 1]
Girl, if you think your man ain't treatin' you right
Sometimes (Sometimes) he stays out in the streets all night
You got your clothes all packed
You got your mind made up, you wanna leave him
You better stop and reconsider, baby
There's another woman waiting to receive him

[Chorus]
A little bit of somethin', yeah, sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
A little bit of somethin', sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
You better hold on to what you got
Because what you think is nothin' to someone else may be a lot

[Verse 2]
Now, there's an old old story, and I believe it's true
You can't have your cake and eat it, too
Some women are never satisfied, they do everything in a rush
They don't seem to realize that a bird in a hand is worth three in a bush

[Chorus]
A little bit of somethin', yeah, sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
A little bit of somethin', sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
You better hold on to what you got
What you think is nothin' to someone else may be a lot

[Outro]
A little bit of somethin', sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
A little bit of somethin', sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
Hold on to what you got
Hold on
