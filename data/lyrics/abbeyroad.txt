Octopus’s Garden

[Verse 1]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 2]
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe (Happy and they’re safe)
We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you

[Outro]
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you


Polythene Pam

[Verse 1]
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes "The News of the World"
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Hey!) Great!


Mean Mr Mustard

[Verse 1]
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

[Verse 2]
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man


Oh! Darling

Oh Darling I
Will confess you are quite a find

But oh darling I
Sometimes struggle with my wilful mind

Cos I used to feel love being so unattached
And once they were hung up I would never look back
With fire in my nature I would scold all the moths
But your love is making me soft

Oh darling, what now?
Distant hurts when it makes us doubt
And oh darling, it’s strange
To lose the trust in a moment’s rage

Because we only just met, maybe three months ago
And now you're away and it is covered in snow
And it’s good to be faithful, but the bed is so cold
But your love is making me grow

Oh darling, confess
These nights pass like some unholy test

But oh darling it's best
To see through love that our hearts are blessed

Cos I know that I’ve known you for so many lives
And I’ll live with the secret if you'll make up the time
And clutching you so gently I will love every bit
And open this heart to commit

Cos I know that I’ve known you for so many lives
And I’ll live with the secret if you'll make up the time
And clutching you so gently I will love every bit
And open this heart to commit
Yes I'll open this heart to commit
Yes I'll open this heart to commit


Sun King

[Chorus]
Aaah, here come the sun king
Here come the sun king

[Bridge]
Everybody's laughing
Everybody's happy

[Chorus]
Here come the sun king

[Outro]
Quando para mucho mi amore de felice corazón
Mundo paparazzi mi amore chicka ferdy parasol
Cuesto obrigado tanta mucho que canite carousel


Something

[Chorus]
A little bit of somethin', sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
A little bit of somethin', sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
You better hold on to what you got
Because what you think is nothin' to someone else may be a lot

[Verse 1]
Girl, if you think your man ain't treatin' you right
Sometimes (Sometimes) he stays out in the streets all night
You got your clothes all packed
You got your mind made up, you wanna leave him
You better stop and reconsider, baby
There's another woman waiting to receive him

[Chorus]
A little bit of somethin', yeah, sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
A little bit of somethin', sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
You better hold on to what you got
Because what you think is nothin' to someone else may be a lot

[Verse 2]
Now, there's an old old story, and I believe it's true
You can't have your cake and eat it, too
Some women are never satisfied, they do everything in a rush
They don't seem to realize that a bird in a hand is worth three in a bush

[Chorus]
A little bit of somethin', yeah, sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
A little bit of somethin', sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
You better hold on to what you got
What you think is nothin' to someone else may be a lot

[Outro]
A little bit of somethin', sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
A little bit of somethin', sure beats a whole lot of nothin', baby
Hold on to what you got
Hold on


You Never Give Me Your Money

[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

[Instrumental break 1:49-2:29]

[Verse 4]
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

[Outro]

Here Comes The Sun

Paroles de la chanson Here Comes The Sun :
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it´s all right

Little darling, it´s been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it´s been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it´s all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it´s been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it´s all right

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it´s been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it´s all right

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
It´s all right, it´s all right


Her Majesty

[Verse]
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah
Someday I'm going to make her mine


Maxwell’s Silver Hammer

[Verse 1]
Joan was quizzical;
Studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine 
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay
When the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be so, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
(Do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
(Do-do-do-do)

[Verse 3]
P. C. 31 said, "We caught a dirty one,"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, 
Screaming from the gallery, say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oa
(Do-do-do-do-do)
(Silver hammer man)
