It's All Too Much

[Intro]
It's all too much
It's all too much

[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

[Chorus]
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

[Verse 2]
Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

[Chorus]
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

[Verse 3]
Sail me on a silver sun, where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

[Chorus]
It's all to much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

[Outro]
It's too much
Ah, it's too much

With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue

You're too much, ah
We all get too much

Too much, too much, too much
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a

Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much


All You Need Is Love

Paroles de la chanson All You Need Is Love :
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
There's nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you
In time - It's easy

All you need is love, all you need is love
All you need is love, love, love is all you need
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
All you need is love, all you need is love
All you need is love, love, love is all you need
There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy
All you need is love, all you need is love
All you need is love, love, love is all you need
All you need is love (all together now)
All you need is love (everybody)
All you need is love, love, love is all you need


Only A Northern Song

[Verse 1]
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote it like that

[Verse 2]
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

[Chorus 1]
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 2]
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song

[Verse 3]
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no one there


Hey Bulldog

[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Sheepdog
Standing in the rain
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Child-like
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

[Chorus: John Lennon]
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

[Verse 3: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & Ringo Starr]
Big man (Yeah)
Walking in the park
Wigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue

[Chorus: John Lennon]
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Wahoo woof! Woof!
Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!

[Speech: John Lennon]
Hey man, what's that boy?
Woof!
What do you say?
I said "woof!"
You know anymore?
Wooaah ha ha ha!
You've got it, that's it, you had it!
That's it, man, woo!
That's it! You've got it!
Don't look at me man, I only have ten children
Ah ho! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Quiet boy, quiet!
Okay
Quiet!

[Outro: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!
